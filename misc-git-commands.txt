Create a new repository via website
https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo

Create a new repository on the command line

touch README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/rpguiteras/try-github.git
git push -u origin master

Push an existing repository from the command line

# To push our local repo to the GitHub server we'll need to add a remote repository.
# This command takes a remote name and a repository URL, which in your case is https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git.
git remote add origin https://github.com/rpguiteras/try-github.git

# The push command tells Git where to put our commits when we're ready
# The name of our remote is origin and the default local branch name is master. 
# The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do.
git push -u origin master

# We can check for changes on our GitHub repository and pull down any new changes by running:

git pull origin master

# Let's take a look at what is different from our last commit by using the git diff command.

# In this case we want the diff of our most recent commit, which we can refer to using the HEAD pointer.

git diff HEAD

# can diff with staged to see differences
git diff --staged

# sometimes have to q to exit
